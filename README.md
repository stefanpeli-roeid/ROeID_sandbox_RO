# ERICA - EUDI Relying Party Integration Compliance Analyzer

A comprehensive debugging tool for OpenID4VP Presentation Requests and Responses, supporting the EUDI Wallet Architecture & Reference Framework.

---

## Important Disclaimer

**ERICA is a development and debugging tool - NOT a compliance certification service.**

- Passing all checks in ERICA does not guarantee compliance with EUDI sandbox requirements
- ERICA helps developers identify common issues and speed up integration
- ERICA checks are manually maintained and may not be complete or correct
- There is no guarantee of completeness or correctness - always verify against official specifications

**Before production deployment:**

1. Conduct thorough security audits
2. Verify compliance with official EUDI certification processes
3. Test against official EUDI conformance tests
4. Review [VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md](docs/VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md) to understand what ERICA checks

**ERICA is provided as-is for development assistance only. Your own compliance verification is required.**

## Quick Start with Docker

Build and run from source using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://gitlab.opencode.de/bmi/eudi-wallet/erica.git
cd erica

# Start ERICA with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Access the web UI
open http://localhost:3001
```
### Docker Components

The Docker setup includes:

- Web Frontend (port 3001) - Interactive debugging interface
- API Server (port 3001/api) - REST API for validation and simulation
- Core Library - Validation and simulation engine

## What Does ERICA Do?

ERICA helps Relying Parties (RPs) integrating with the EUDI Wallet ecosystem by providing:

### 1. Request Validation

Analyzes OpenID4VP Presentation Requests for:

- Syntax correctness (valid JWT structure, URL format)
- Required fields (client_id, nonce, response_uri, etc.)
- DCQL query structure and credential requests
- Security checks (certificate validation, signature verification)
- Profile compliance (EUDI HAIP, ARF requirements)

### 2. Wallet Simulation

Simulates different wallet behaviors:

- Compliant Mode - Generates valid PID presentations
- Test Modes - Simulates common errors (expired credentials, wrong signatures, etc.)
- SD-JWT Support - Selective disclosure with proper crypto
- Certificate Infrastructure - Uses stable test certificates for consistent testing

### 3. Response Validation

Validates wallet responses from the RP's perspective:

- VP Token structure and format
- Credential signatures and trust chains
- Holder binding (KB-JWT validation)
- Nonce and audience verification
- Claim matching against requested attributes

### 4. Trust List Management

- Registrar Validation - Checks RP Access Certificates against trust list
- Certificate Expiration - Validates certificate validity periods
- Signature Verification - Verifies JWT signatures using certificate public keys

---

## Using the Web Interface

### Basic Usage

1. **Choose Input Method:**
   - Authorization URL - Paste a complete `openid4vp://` or `https://` URL
   - JSON Request - Paste or edit the request JSON directly

2. **Enter Your Request:**
   - Paste an authorization URL from your RP
   - Or paste/edit the JSON request object
   - ERICA validates as you type

3. **Review Validation Results:**
   - Technical Details - All validation checks organized by category
   - Summary - Pass/fail overview with error counts
   - Diagnostics - Detailed explanations and spec references

### Wallet Simulation Settings

These options are visible in the main form:

- **Simulation Mode:**

  Available modes:
  - `VALID` - Generates valid, spec-compliant responses
  - `EXPIRED` - Simulates expired credential (exp in past)
  - `NOT_YET_VALID` - Simulates not-yet-valid credential (nbf in future)
  - `INVALID_SIGNATURE` - Signature signed with wrong key
  - `MISSING_SIGNATURE` - Credential without signature
  - `MISSING_CLAIMS` - Omits requested attributes
  - `OVER_DISCLOSURE` - Returns more claims than requested
  - `WRONG_NONCE` - Uses incorrect nonce in KB-JWT
  - `MISSING_HOLDER_BINDING` - Omits KB-JWT entirely
  - `WRONG_AUDIENCE` - Uses incorrect audience in KB-JWT

  Planned modes (not yet implemented):
  - `MODIFIED_CLAIMS` - Tampered claim values
  - `FORMAT_MISMATCH` - Wrong credential format
  - `MALFORMED_SD_JWT` - Invalid SD-JWT structure
  - `WRONG_ISSUER` - Incorrect issuer DID/URL
  - `WRONG_CREDENTIAL_TYPE` - Incorrect vct value

- **PID Template:**
  - `normal` - Standard German PID data
  - `special-characters` - Tests Unicode/special characters (umlauts, etc.)
  - `incomplete-birthdate` - Tests partial birthdate formats

- **Validation Profile:**
  - `PID Presentation (EUDI)` - EUDI HAIP profile for German PID (default)
  - `OpenID4VP Base` - Base OpenID4VP without EUDI-specific rules

- **PID Template:**
  - Selects which test data variant to use

- **Credential Format:**
  - `SD-JWT` - SD-JWT format (default, recommended)
  - `mDoc` - ISO mDoc format (not yet fully supported)

### Additional Options

Click "Additional Options" to access:

- **Only validate request (don't POST response back)** - When unchecked, ERICA will simulate a complete wallet flow and POST the VP token to your response_uri (recommended for full integration testing).

### Understanding Results

#### Validation Checks are Categorized:

- Syntax - Basic format and structure errors
- Semantics - Logical consistency and field relationships
- Security - Cryptographic validation and trust anchors
- Profile - EUDI-specific requirements (ARF, HAIP)
- Protocol - OpenID4VP protocol compliance

#### Check Status:

- PASS - Check succeeded
- FAIL - Check failed (see details for explanation)
- WARNING - Potential issue (may be acceptable in some contexts)

Each failed check includes:

- Issue - What went wrong
- Suggested Fix - How to resolve it
- Spec Reference - Link to relevant specification (when available)

---

## API Usage

ERICA also provides a REST API for automated testing:

```bash
# Validate and simulate a request
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/debug \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "request": { /* your authorization request */ },
    "validationProfile": "pid-presentation",
    "simulationMode": "VALID"
  }'
```

## Security & Certificates

### Test Certificates

ERICA uses stable test certificates for the wallet simulator:

- PID Issuer Certificate - Available at `GET /api/issuer/trust-anchor`
- Registrar Certificates - Loaded from `src/security/trustlist/registrar.jwt`

All certificates are TEST ONLY - clearly labeled "DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION"

For RPs testing against ERICA:

1. Fetch the issuer trust anchor: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/issuer/trust-anchor`
2. Add to your test trust list (test environment only)
3. Your RP can now verify PIDs signed by ERICA's wallet simulator

See [KEY_MANAGEMENT.md](docs/KEY_MANAGEMENT.md) for certificate details.
